# PPSR Registration Upload System

This project implements a full-stack solution for batch uploading and processing of motor vehicle PPSR registrations via CSV files.

## Features

### Backend (.NET 8, EF Core, PostgreSQL)
- RESTful API for uploading CSV files
- Stream-based ingestion for memory efficiency
- Data validation and normalization:
  - Flexible date parsing (e.g., `24/02/2025`, `2025-02-24`)
  - VIN normalization (trimmed, uppercase)
  - ACN normalization (whitespace removed)
- Updates existing records if VIN + Grantor + ACN already exists
- Fully containerized using Docker Compose
- Unit tests using xUnit and Moq

### Frontend (Vite + React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS)
- CSV file upload form with validations
- Displays full upload summary: total, added, updated, invalid
- Shows warnings (e.g., normalized values, missing data)
- Smooth scroll and UI transitions

## Architecture
The backend adopts a **microservice-inspired architecture**, even though currently implemented as a single service. It follows a clean, modular project layout:
```
PPSR.Registration/
â””â”€â”€ services/                  
    â”œâ”€â”€ PPSR.Registration.Domain      
    â”œâ”€â”€ PPSR.Registration.Application
    â”œâ”€â”€ PPSR.Registration.Infrastructure
    â””â”€â”€ PPSR.Registration.WebApi.Ingestor
```
This separation of concerns makes it **highly extensible**, allowing new services (e.g., audit logging, analytics) to be added easily in the future.

> Example: You can introduce a dedicated microservice like `PPSR.Registration.Audit` to asynchronously track changes via a message queue.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with `yarn` installed

### Folder Structure
```
PPSR.Registration/
â”œâ”€â”€ client/                     # Frontend (React + Vite)
â””â”€â”€ services/                   # Backend services
    â”œâ”€â”€ PPSR.Registration.*     # Clean architecture structure
    â””â”€â”€ docker-compose.yml      # PostgreSQL container
```

### 1. Setup PostgreSQL with Docker
```bash
cd PPSR.Registration
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Run Migrations
```bash
cd services
# Apply EF Core migration to PostgreSQL
dotnet ef database update -s PPSR.Registration.WebApi.Ingestor
```

### 3. Run Backend
```bash
cd services
dotnet run --project PPSR.Registration.WebApi.Ingestor
# Runs at https://localhost:7066
```

### 4. Run Frontend
```bash
cd client
yarn install
yarn dev
# Opens at http://localhost:5173
```

> Ensure CORS is enabled and `POSTGRES_*` env vars are set in `.env`.

## Highlights
- Graceful handling of malformed CSV
- Smart defaults and auto-corrections (e.g., comma in name â†’ space)
- Shows timestamp and line-level warning messages
- Easily extendable (e.g., batch id tracking, audit logging)

---

## Tech Stack
- Backend: .NET 8, EF Core, PostgreSQL
- Frontend: React 19, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Vite
- DevOps: Docker, Yarn, Git, Swagger

---

## Project Status
This implementation meets **all functional and technical requirements** outlined in the InfoTrack exercise, including smart normalization, user feedback, and full containerization.

Ready for review or further extension as a production-grade system.
